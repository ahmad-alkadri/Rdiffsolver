# **Rdiffsolver**

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/ahmad-alkadri/Rdiffsolver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ahmad-alkadri/Rdiffsolver)

Like its name implies, *Rdiffsolver* is an R package 
with many functions used for solving the diffusion equation. 
I wrote these functions first in MATLAB, and I ported them 
to R so that I can use it anywhere without 
having to install MATLAB nor paying its license (quite 
expensive, seriously).

This package, as you can clearly see, is still 
in development. In the future, I'll translate more 
and more of the codes that I have written in MATLAB 
to R and add more functionalities to this package. 
Expect to have some additional features, such as:

+ non-uniform initial condition,
+ nonlinear diffusion, or concentration-dependant coefficient of diffusion,
+ estimating the coefficient of diffusion based on experimental data through curve-fitting,
+ many others.

If you have any advice, inputs, 
or even if you want to contribute,
