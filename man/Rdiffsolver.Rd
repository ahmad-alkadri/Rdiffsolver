\title{Rdiffsolver: A simple R package for solving diffusion equation with numerical methods.}
\description{
The \strong{Rdiffsolver} package provides currently one basic function:
diff.1D, which can solve the diffusion equation in unidimensional
direction, with constant boundary conditions
(dirichlet and neumann with zero flux).
}
\details{
\strong{Methods:} Finite differences with backward Euler
implicit method (\emph{diff.1D} function).
